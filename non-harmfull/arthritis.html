                <span class="info-1">Arthritis is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects joints.
                    Symptoms generally include joint pain and stiffness. Other symptoms may include redness, warmth,
                    swelling, and decreased range of motion of the affected joints.In some types of arthritis,
                    other organs are also affected.Onset can be gradual or sudden.

                    There are over 100 types of arthritis.The most common forms are osteoarthritis
                    (degenerative joint disease) and rheumatoid arthritis.Osteoarthritis usually occurs with age and
                    affects the fingers, knees, and hips.Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that
                    often affects the hands and feet.[7] Other types include gout, lupus, fibromyalgia, and septic
                    arthritis.They are all types of rheumatic disease.

                    Treatment may include resting the joint and alternating between applying ice and heat.Weight
                    loss and exercise may also be useful.Recommended medications may depend on the form of
                    arthritis. These may include pain medications such as ibuprofen and paracetamol
                    (acetaminophen).In some circumstances, a joint replacement may be useful.

                    Osteoarthritis affects more than 3.8% of people, while rheumatoid arthritis affects about 0.24% of
                    people.Gout affects about 1â€“2% of the Western population at some point in their lives. In
                    Australia about 15% of people are affected by arthritis,while in the United States more than
                    20% have a type of arthritis.Overall the disease becomes more common with age.
                    Arthritis is a common reason that people miss work and can result in a decreased quality of life.

                        <img src="images/dark-dot.jpg" class="notation">Pain, which can vary in severity, is a common
                        symptom in virtually all types of arthritis.Other symptoms include swelling, joint
                        stiffness, redness, and aching around the joint(s).Arthritic disorders like lupus and
                        rheumatoid arthritis can affect other organs in the body, leading to a variety of symptoms.
                        Symptoms may include:

                        Inability to use the hand or walk
                        Stiffness in one or more joints
                        Rash or itch
                        Malaise and fatigue
                        Weight loss
                        Poor sleep
                        Muscle aches and pains
                        Tenderness
                        Difficulty moving the joint
                        It is common in advanced arthritis for significant secondary changes to occur. For example,
                        arthritic symptoms might make it difficult for a person to move around and/or exercise, which
                        can lead to secondary effects, such as:

                            <img src="images/dark-dot.jpg" class="notation">Osteoarthritis happens naturally as you age â€” a lifetime of using your joints can eventually wear down their cartilage cushioning.
                            You may develop gout if you have too much uric acid in your blood (hyperuricemia).
                            Your immune system can cause arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis) when it damages your joints by mistake.
                            Certain viral infections (including COVID-19) can trigger viral arthritis.
                            Sometimes, arthritis happens with no cause or trigger. Providers call this idiopathic arthritis
