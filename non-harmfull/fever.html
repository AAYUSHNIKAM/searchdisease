        <span class="info-1">Fever or pyrexia in humans is defined as having a body temperature above the normal range due to an increase in the body's temperature set point in the hypothalamus.There is no single agreed-upon upper limit for normal temperature: sources use values ranging between 37.2 and 38.3 Â°C (99.0 and 100.9 Â°F) in humans.The increase in set point triggers increased muscle contractions and causes a feeling of cold or chills. This results in greater heat production and efforts to conserve heat.When the set point temperature returns to normal, a person feels hot, becomes flushed, and may begin to sweat.Rarely a fever may trigger a febrile seizure, with this being more common in young children.Fevers do not typically go higher than 41 to 42 Â°C (106 to 108 Â°F).

            A fever can be caused by many medical conditions ranging from non-serious to life-threatening.This includes viral, bacterial, and parasitic infectionsâ€”such as influenza, the common cold, meningitis, urinary tract infections, appendicitis, Lassa, COVID-19, and malaria.Non-infectious causes include vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis, connective tissue disease, side effects of medication or vaccination, and cancer. It differs from hyperthermia, in that hyperthermia is an increase in body temperature over the temperature set point, due to either too much heat production or not enough heat loss.
            
            Treatment to reduce fever is generally not required.Treatment of associated pain and inflammation, however, may be useful and help a person rest. Medications such as ibuprofen or paracetamol (acetaminophen) may help with this as well as lower temperature.Children younger than three months require medical attention, as might people with serious medical problems such as a compromised immune system or people with other symptoms. Hyperthermia requires treatment.
            
            Fever is one of the most common medical signs.It is part of about 30% of healthcare visits by children and occurs in up to 75% of adults who are seriously sick. While fever evolved as a defense mechanism, treating a fever does not appear to improve or worsen outcomes.Fever is often viewed with greater concern by parents and healthcare professionals than is usually deserved, a phenomenon known as "fever phobia.

             <img src="images/dark-dot.jpg"  class="notation">Body temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day. The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever</br>
