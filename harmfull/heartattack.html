             <img src="images/dark-dot.jpg"  class="notation"> a feeling of pressure, heaviness, tightness or squeezing across your chest
             pain in other parts of the body â€“ it can feel as if the pain is spreading from your chest to your arms (usually the left arm, but it can affect both arms), jaw, neck, back and tummy
             feeling lightheaded or dizzy
             sweating
             shortness of breath
             feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting)
             an overwhelming feeling of anxiety (similar to a panic attack)
             coughing or wheezing
             The chest pain is often severe, but some people may only experience minor pain, similar to indigestion.
             
             While the most common symptom is chest pain, symptoms can vary from person to person. Some people may have other symptoms such as shortness of breath, feeling or being sick and back or jaw pain without any chest pain.

             <span class="info-1"><span class="question"><br>ðŸ‘‰ causes of heart attack</br></span>
            <img src="images/dark-dot.jpg"  class="notation">The most common cause of a heart attack is a blockage in one of the arteries near the heart.

            This can result from coronary heart disease, in which plaque â€” made up of cholesterol and other substances â€” collects in the arteries, narrowing them. Over time, this can obstruct the flow of blood.Your heart muscle needs a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood. Your coronary arteries give your heart this critical blood supply. If you have coronary artery disease, those arteries become narrow, and blood canâ€™t flow as well as it should. When your blood supply is blocked, you have a heart attack.

            Fat, calcium, proteins, and inflammatory cells build up in your arteries to form plaques. These plaque deposits are hard on the outside and soft and mushy on the inside.
            
            When the plaque is hard, the outer shell cracks. This is called a rupture. Platelets (disc-shaped cells in your blood that help it clot) come to the area, and blood clots form around the plaque. If a blood clot blocks your artery, your heart muscle becomes starved for oxygen. The muscle cells soon die, causing permanent damage.
            
            Rarely, a spasm in your coronary artery can also cause a heart attack. During this coronary spasm, your arteries restrict or spasm on and off, cutting off the blood supply to your heart muscle (ischemia). It can happen while youâ€™re at rest and even if you donâ€™t have serious coronary artery disease.
