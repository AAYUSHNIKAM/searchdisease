        <span class="info-1">A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection that affects your nose, throat, sinuses and windpipe (trachea). You may have heard that the common cold is a coronavirus. In fact, more than 200 different types of viruses can cause a cold. The most common cold virus is the rhinovirus.

          We call colds ‚Äúcommon‚Äù because as their name implies, they‚Äôre widespread. You‚Äôll probably have more colds in your lifetime than any other illness. Adults catch two to three colds a year, while young children come down with a cold four or more times a year.
          <span class="info-2"><span class="question"><br>üëâsymptoms</br>
        
            </span></br>
            
        
            
             <img src="images/dark-dot.jpg"  class="notation">Within one to three days of picking up a cold virus, you may notice a tickle in your throat. About half of all people with colds report a tickly or sore throat as their first symptom. Other common cold symptoms you may experience during this early stage include:

             Sneezing.
             Runny nose.
             Stuffy nose (nasal congestion).
             Cough.
             Hoarseness
             Cold symptoms usually begin with a sore throat, which usually goes away after a day or two. Nasal symptoms, runny nose, and congestion follow, along with a cough by the fourth and fifth days. Fever is uncommon in adults, but a slight fever is possible. Children are more likely to have a fever with a cold.

             With cold symptoms, the nose teems with watery nasal secretions for the first few days. Later, these become thicker and darker. Dark mucus is natural and does not usually mean you have developed a bacterial infection, such as a sinus infection.
             </br>
             <span class="info-3"><span class="question"><br>üëâcauses</br></span>
            <img src="images/dark-dot.jpg"  class="notation">It is called the common cold for good reason. There are over one billion colds in the United States each year. You and your children will probably have more colds than any other type of illness.

            Colds are the most common reason that children miss school and parents miss work. Parents often get colds from their children.
            
            Children can get many colds every year. They usually get them from other children. A cold can spread quickly through schools or daycares.
            
            Colds can occur at any time of the year, but they are most common in the winter or rainy seasons.
            
            A cold virus spreads through tiny, air droplets that are released when the sick person sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose.
            
            You can catch a cold if:
            A person with a cold sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose near you
            You touch your nose, eyes, or mouth after you have touched something contaminated by the virus, such as a toy or doorknob
