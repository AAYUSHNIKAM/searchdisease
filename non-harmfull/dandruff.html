                <span class="info-1">Dandruff is a skin condition that mainly affects the scalp.Symptoms include
                    flaking and sometimes mild itchiness.It can result in social or self-esteem problems.A
                    more severe form of the condition, which includes inflammation of the skin, is known as seborrhoeic
                    dermatitis.

                    The cause is unclear, but believed to involve a number of genetic and environmental factors;the
                    condition may worsen in the winter.It is not due to poor hygiene,and the underlying
                    mechanism involves the excessive growth of skin cells.Diagnosis is based on symptoms.

                    There is no known cure for dandruff.Antifungal cream, such as ketoconazole, or salicylic acid
                    may be used to try to improve the condition.Dandruff affects about half of adults, with males
                    more often affected than females.In addition, people in all areas of the world are affected.
                    Onset is usually at puberty, and it becomes less common after the age of 50.

                            involve a number of genetic and environmental factors.

                            As the skin layers continually replace themselves, cells are pushed outward where they die
                            and flake off. For most individuals, these flakes of skin are too small to be visible.
                            However, certain conditions cause cell turnover to be unusually rapid, especially in the
                            scalp. It is hypothesized that for people with dandruff, skin cells may mature and be shed
                            in two to seven days, as opposed to around a month in people without dandruff. The result is
                            that dead skin cells are shed in large, oily clumps, which appear as white or grayish flakes
                            on the scalp, skin and clothes.Skin oil, commonly referred to as sebum or sebaceous secretions
